# ansible-dk

An omnibus-based toolkit for working on Ansible-based infrastructure code.

That means, this project is a set of scripts to build OS packages that bundle together a bunch of tools to make developing with Ansible more robust, reliable, fast, and fun - in other words, a SDLC kit for ansible.  Unless you are contributing to this project, you almost certainly don't need this source code; you're instead looking for the binary OS packages.

## Using the Binaries

### Downloading the OS Packages

Packages for Ubuntu 14.04 (.deb) and Mac OS X (.dmg) are available at https://github.com/omniti-labs/ansible-dk/releases/latest .

### Using the binaries

Installation should be straightforward using your OS's normal package manager.  We install to /opt/ansible-dk, and are careful to not interfere with any existing system Python or Ruby installations.  Uninstalls and upgrades should be clean.

Once you have your package installed, to use the tools, run this magic command in your Bash shell:

    eval "$(ansible-dk shell-init bash)"

This will alter various environment variables so that the Ansible DK's tools appear first in your path, along with all the Python and Ruby libraries they need.

(Currently only bash is supported; patches welcome.)

## Tools Contained in the Kit

#### A Ruby 2.1.x Runtime

This allows us to manage our own gem universe without the user having to know about things like Bundler, rvm, or rbenv.

#### A Python 2.7.x Runtime

This allows us to manage our own module universe without the user having to know about things like virtualenv.

#### ansible-dk CLI tool

This gets symlinked into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, depending on your OS, and is the only change outside of /opt/ansible-dk.

#### ansible 2.0.x

The ansible tool itself.

#### ansible-lint

[Ansible-lint](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint) is a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) for ansible.

#### ansible-toolkit

[Ansible-toolkit](https://github.com/dellis23/ansible-toolkit) provides several tools to improve visibility and predictability of roles and vault management.

#### test-kitchen, kitchen-vagrant, and kitchen-ansible

[Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) is a very popular infrastructure testing harness.

#### Molecule

[Molecule](https://github.com/metacloud/molecule) is a tool to ease (automated) testing for Ansible roles.

#### AWS Support: kitchen-ec2, AWS cli, boto library, and jq

Everything you need to have test machines in AWS, plus have dynamic inventory.  jq is included for inventory diagnostics.

## Project Roadmap

### Tools we plan to include

The workflow that the authors use includes using test-kitchen to create and destroy test VMs, with serverspec being used to author the tests.  That's not prescriptive, though - you can do whatever you like.  Our goal is for the Ansible DK to provide enough variety of tools for you to implement a workflow that you prefer.

Long-term, we're open to contributions from the community - such as BATS support, or digitalocean support, for example.  But those are not the current needs of OmniTI, so we will not be focusing on them at the moment.

### Platforms we plan to target

Based on OmniTI's (perhaps idiosyncratic) needs, we initially plan to build packages for:

 * OS X Yosemite
 * OS X El Capitan (commiting to latest Mac OS, plus previous version)
 * Ubuntu 14.04 (commiting to LTS support on ubuntu)

We do not currently have a need for Debian, CentOS, RHEL, or FreeBSD packaging, but such contributions would be very welcome from the community.

At some point in the future, we will likely add OmniOS LTS packaging, which we would aim to also cover SmartOS and Oracle Solaris.

We will probably never have need for a Windows package, but if there are community members willing to implement, test, and maintain it, we'll accept it.

## Bug and Limitations

Probably a great many!  If you find one, open an issue at https://github.com/omniti-labs/ansible-dk/issues .

## Feature Requests and Contributing

If you have something you wish to see added, but have no idea how to do that in Omnibus, please open an issue at https://github.com/omniti-labs/ansible-dk/issues .

If you have some experience doing Omnibus packaging, which is perhaps not for the faint of heart, or are simply exceptionally intrepid, have a read over the Omnibus instructions at https://github.com/chef/omnibus , then do the usual fork-PR workflow on this repo.

ansible-dk Omnibus project
=========================
This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`ansible-dk`!

Installation
------------
You must have a sane Ruby 1.9+ environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all
the required gems are installed:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

Usage
-----
### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus build ansible-dk
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform
where the `build project` command is invoked. For example, running this command
on a MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X package. After the build completes
packages will be available in the `pkg/` folder.

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean ansibledk
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/ansibledk`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean ansibledk --purge
```

### Publish

Omnibus has a built-in mechanism for releasing to a variety of "backends", such
as Amazon S3. You must set the proper credentials in your `omnibus.rb` config
file or specify them via the command line.

```shell
$ bin/omnibus publish path/to/*.deb --backend s3
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```

Version Manifest
----------------

Git-based software definitions may specify branches as their
default_version. In this case, the exact git revision to use will be
determined at build-time unless a project override (see below) or
external version manifest is used.  To generate a version manifest use
the `omnibus manifest` command:

```
omnibus manifest PROJECT -l warn
```

This will output a JSON-formatted manifest containing the resolved
version of every software definition.

## Note
When building new versions, clear local build cache.  Stale or broken builds could get built in.
```shell
$ rm -rf local/build local/cache /opt/ansible-dk/*
```

Kitchen-based Build Environment
-------------------------------
Every Omnibus project ships will a project-specific
[Berksfile](http://berkshelf.com/) that will allow you to build your omnibus projects on all of the projects listed
in the `.kitchen.yml`. You can add/remove additional platforms as needed by
changing the list found in the `.kitchen.yml` `platforms` YAML stanza.

This build environment is designed to get you up-and-running quickly. However,
there is nothing that restricts you to building on other platforms. Simply use
the [omnibus cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/omnibus) to setup
your desired platform and execute the build steps listed above.

The default build environment requires Test Kitchen and VirtualBox for local
development. Test Kitchen also exposes the ability to provision instances using
various cloud providers like AWS, DigitalOcean, or OpenStack. For more
information, please see the [Test Kitchen documentation](http://kitchen.ci).

Once you have tweaked your `.kitchen.yml` (or `.kitchen.local.yml`) to your
liking, you can bring up an individual build environment using the `kitchen`
command.

```shell
$ bin/kitchen converge ubuntu-1204
```

Then login to the instance and build the project as described in the Usage
section:

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen login ubuntu-1204
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ cd ansibledk
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bundle install
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ ...
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bin/omnibus build ansibledk
```

For a complete list of all commands and platforms, run `kitchen list` or
`kitchen help`.
